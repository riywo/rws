# Robust web system with Linux

POC

## What is RWS?

RWS is "robust" web system architecture. "Robust" means:

- stable
    - no SPOF(Single Point Of Failure)
- sustainable
    - continuous changing/updating software/libraries
- simple
    - understandable for most people
    - common software/libraries
    - less manual operations

## Why?

There are many ways to construct a web system, so everyone is confused everytime. Usually "LAMP" is used as a general way, but this word is not tangible. I want to figure out all details of the elements of an architecture, which is the best practice I think *so far*.


# RWS components

Here is a list of components which should be considered in RWS and the best practice for each component.
